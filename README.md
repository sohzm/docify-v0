# Docify

A decentralized blockchain based platform to verify and validate user documents and prevent fraud. 

This project uses IPFS with [web3.storage](https://web3.storage)'s api.
This repo contains 3 different server and frontend codes which will be used in the project in the 3 directories.

### Before you start

Encryption to the data isn't added, which means there are no passwords (currently).

### Getting started

There are 3 servers run all the go files in `login/cmd`, `org/cmd` and `portal` (Builds were not tested). Then open the `localhost:port` that portal is using.
